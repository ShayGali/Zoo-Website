This project was built as part of an react course.
We had to build a site that represents a zoo, with the option to add animals and edit the information about them.

The information is stored in a firebase firestore database.

The site is a responsive site built using bootstrap.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
